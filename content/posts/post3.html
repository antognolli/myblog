MeeGo Conf happened from May 23-25, in San Francisco, CA at the Hyatt Embacadero Center and I went there to meet the MeeGo people, especially people from projects that I develop like ConnMan, oFono and BlueZ and check what are the new stuff on MeeGo.

This time we had no free devices! But we had the announcement of MeeGo tablet during the Conference keynote, one of the first devices running MeeGo.

Some talks I attended there: “MeeGo connectivity: State of the union – what comes next …” by Marcel Holtmann,  who talked about how far we got with ConnMan, oFono and BlueZ integration to give a solid connectivity  platform.; “Connman Tethering API” by Samuel Ortiz which showed a quite easy to use free software tethering implementation. Samuel evene mentioned me in his talk due to some work I did on the ConnMan’s PrivateNetwork API (one of the pieces of the Thethering code); “Qt Open Governance Progress” by Tiago Maciera talking about how Qt will be managed by community and “Systemd for MeeGo – fastboot 2.0?” by Auke Kok reporting the speed ups gains with the systemd, that will be  in MeeGo 1.3 (the next version).

Also I was able to discuss with Marcel some issues I’m having in the rewrite of the L2CAP Protocol (Expect a post on this subject soon!)

It was nice see lot of new stuff about MeeGo and that its commit is doing great even with Nokia’s back out, more people are joining MeeGo and release 1.3 will be a lot better.

Finally, I would like to thank ProFUSION and MeeGo Conference for sponsor my travel to San Francisco.
