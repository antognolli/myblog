Well, I'm finally putting my blog online, and hope to have some interesting
stuff to post here. I'll be probably talking a lot about work that I'm doing on
[EFL], and sometimes on [WebKit] too. And since I've been lately also doing
some stuff in the game development area, you can also expect some posts on this
topic too.

This blog is also powered by [nanoc], so I'm probably going to share some
thoughts and code for this awesome framework. At least I plan to publish the
template used for this blog, that could be a good start for anyone wanting to
start a blog with nanoc with the setup already done. This way maybe I also
receive some critics on the way that I implemented things, and can change it to
somethings better.
