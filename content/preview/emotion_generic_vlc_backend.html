Emotion is the [EFL] library that handles audio and video playback. It had only
two backends: *gstreamer* and *xine*. But recently, [Zodiac Aerospace] asked
[ProFUSION] to integrate a [VLC] backend that was being developed originally by
Hugo Camboulive. The end result of this work is a *generic* backend, which was
used to give Emotion support to play files using VLC, but can also support other
players.

This generic player backend executes a separated player in another
process. It receives the bytes to be drawn on the Emotion object through
a shared memory, and communicates/controls the player through a pipe. The pipe
file descriptors to be used are sent to the player through command line
arguments, leaving the standard input/output free to be used if necessary.

The player must receive and send commands defined on a common file called
`Emotion_Generic_Plugin.h`, which can be included for easier implementation.
However, there's no need for the player to link against Emotion.

#### How does it work?

When the module is initialized for an emotion object, it starts another process
that runs the specified player. The player command line is specified using:

<pre><code class="language-c">
<% h do %>
emotion_object_module_option_set(object, "player", <command_to_player>);
<% end %>
</code></pre>

A player using libvlc is being provided now, and the generic module internally
checks if the command given was "vlc", in which case it will use this provided
emotion-vlc player.

When a file is set to this object, it will send the file name to the player, and
expect an answer that will tell that the player already decoded a bit of the
file, and the video size is already set on the module, so it can allocate a
shared memory with correct size.

The module then allocates the memory, sends a message to the player and expect
an answer. After this last answer, the "open_done" signal is sent and the module
knows that it is ready for playing. Commands sent before the module being ready
are now applied (and play is resumed if necessary).

During this setup stage, info about the file set will be stored in the module,
so commands like meta data get, length get and so will be available to sync
calls like emotion_object_play_length_get().

The playback phase occurs by VLC writing the decoded video data on a shared
memory buffer, which will be used by Emotion to display the decoded frame. A
triple buffering mechanism is used to avoid tearing, and also ensures that no
blocking happens on Emotion when the player is writing the pixels on the buffer.

If the player dies for any reason, a "decode_stop" signal is sent, allowing the
program to call play again, and in that case it will be restarted. The playback
should start from the same point it was before the player crashed (if the player
supports seek on the current media format).

This last point is the main advantage of the generic backend, allowing the
program to recover from a player crash. Similar plugins can be implemented using
gstreamer and xine, isolating the decode from the program UI using a separated
process.

If you have any questions about this backend, please feel free to ask =).
