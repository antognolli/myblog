Recently I attended at LinuxCon Brazil, did a presentation and still had the chance to attend to some interesting talks. I'm a little bit late, but still going to let this registered here for future reference.

The presentation was given together with [Bruno Dilly], about [EFL] focused on embedded devices. Besides some previous similar talks about [EFL], this one was more interesting and quite different, since we didn't talk much about how to write a program using it, but instead focused on its advantages, presented some real use cases and tried to show off where one can take more advantages from these libraries.

You can see the presentation slides online on [Bruno Dilly's post](http://brunodilly.org/blog/?p=32), or get the slides here.

Overall the event was very interesting, with some nice keynotes and presentations. Two of them that draw my attention were Eugeni Dodonov's talk about the Linux Graphical Stack, and Daniel Frye's keynote about the 10+ years of Linux at IBM, which exposed how IBM's LTC (Linux Technology Center) started trying to contribute with Linux, what they did wrong and how they fixed it.

In addition to our talk, 2 more guys from [ProFUSION] were presenting their talks: [Lucas DeMarchi did a talk about how to become an open source developer](http://www.politreco.com/2011/11/linuxcon-brazil/) and [Gustavo Barbieri](http://blog.gustavobarbieri.com.br/) presented two talks: "Tips and Tricks to Develop Software for CE product on Low-End Hardware" and "Demystifying HTML5" with Sulamita Garcia (Intel).

That's all for now, and hopefully there will be more presentations coming on next events.
